## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This assignment uses an R script to read and process accelorometer and gyroscope data collected from smartphones. 

The data is from the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. This data is downloaded and unzipped to a folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' on the local computer.

The UCI HAR Dataset folder contains the following files:
* 'README.txt': General description of the dataset
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## run_analysis.R script

This script assumes that the working directory in the R console includes the files from the UCI HAR Dataset.
